## ⚙️ Installation and Compilation
### 🛠️ Prerequisites
- 🐧 **Linux (Ubuntu)** environment
- 🔧 **CMake** installed
- 🖥️ **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** installed

### 📦 Steps to Build the Project
1. **Clone the Repository** (assuming you have already set up Git):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd my-ls
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Run CMake** to generate Makefiles:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Compile the Project** using `make`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./my_ls [options] [path]
   ```
   - Replace `[options]` with any of the supported options: `-a`, `-l`, `-R`.
   - Replace `[path]` with the directory path you want to list.

## 🌟 Main Features
1. **📋 List Directory Contents**: Similar to the Unix `ls` command, this project lists the contents of a given directory.
2. **🔧 Support for Command-Line Options**:
   - **`-a`**: Show all files, including hidden files (starting with `.`).
   - **`-l`**: Display detailed information about each file (e.g., size, permissions).
   - **`-R`**: Recursively list the contents of all subdirectories.
3. **✨ Customizable Output**: Users can specify different combinations of the options to customize the output.

## 💡 Usage Examples
- **List all files in the current directory, including hidden ones**:
  ```bash
  ./my_ls -a
  ```

- **List all files with detailed information**:
  ```bash
  ./my_ls -l
  ```

- **List files in a specific directory recursively**:
  ```bash
  ./my_ls -R /path/to/directory
  ```

## 📝 Notes
- The project is implemented in C and requires a basic knowledge of the command line to run effectively.
- This implementation includes a subset of the common options available in the Unix `ls` command.
